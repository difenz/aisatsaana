    <p class="bio">Aisatsaana began her journey into the music world from early childhood, devoting 10 years to music college. <br>
        After successfully completing the piano and vocal class, she went on stage with her first instrumental music band, made songs and performed at local concerts. <br> Next, nightlife and movement into the world of electronic music began. <br> <br>
        
        "I was immediately set up for an underground course, it always responded inside, so I quickly began to DJ, at the same time I was still studying at the university. The student years were very diverse and full of adventure and parties. Then I lived in St. Petersburg in Russia and often played in local clubs and bars under a different name. It was a wonderful experience and no less cool acquaintances around the night life of that gorgeous city”
        <br> <br>
        In 2011, after graduating from University, she went to live in Asia, where her own ascent as a sound producer and event organizer began. There was a period of another name, image and search for her own sound through different styles from ambient to breakbeat & techno. In Asia, the first tracks were born, so different and so incomprehensible, dj sets were played, cool parties were organized, trips to European festivals were done and much more. <br> <br>
        
        In 2020, there was a powerful revolution in life and her own Umai Records label was born, where the music of talented artists from Russia, United Kingdom and France was published. As well as joint collaborations and the artist's own releases. Together with the creation of the label, the performer of hypnotic beats began to create abstract paintings, which is later become the covers of the label's releases. <br> <br>
        
        "Everything is interconnected here. Music gives rise to visualization and vice versa. One without the other does not exist" <br> <br>
        
        To this day, she varies her sound between techno, breakbeat, drum & bass, experimental electronic, mixing different directions together. In her work, you can feel something otherworldly, hypnotic, as well as remember the atmosphere of the rave and recognize the border of different times and musical movements. <br> <br>
        
        "I always wanted to communicate with the world through sound and convey my feelings in this way. That makes me feel myself real & alive. When I see and feel how my music changes people, reveals consciousness, how it affects - it is the highest gratitude for my mission”
